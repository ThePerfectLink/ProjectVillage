2. ## Overview
	1.  #### Name
	2. #### Concept
		<p>A god game where a vilalge is built on its own before the player with the very little input required. The player essentially is a god of luck and as such has very little control over the village's progress.</p>
	3. #### Target Audience 
		</p>The Target audience is one that is into god games or town sims that wants to play one in the background of whatever else they are doing. Perhaps people working from home or the office that have acces to their computers and can have this open in the background. As there is no pause button, there's very little reason why one wouldn't have it running most of the time.</p>
	4. #### Scope
		<p>The scope of the game includes the viewing of the town as the villagers go through their lives working, fighting or playing. In this mode, the player will be able to watch the villagers of their town and read up on their lives through logs and retellings of their days through the in game story generation system. This system will log when villagers go to work, wha tthey did, what they said to other villagers and what has been done to said villagers. One can lso view logs of other things as well, such as building, enemies or other objects. With this information, the player will be able to bestow luck on individuals, which can be anything from increased intelligence at key times, to enhanced romantic abilities.
			
		It also may include a more gameplay focused subsection of the game where the player can inhabit the consciousness of a villager as they venture forth into a dungeon or some such thing in order to attempt to guarentee a raid success. This will cost a significant amount of influence, but allows the player to directly interact with the villagers and keep them interested after watching the village for awhile
			
		Villages will also be scored, and leaderboards can be kept from said scoring systems. Villages will be generated on customizable plots of lands generated randomly from certain parameters, so leaderboards will have to be localized to certain settings.</p>
1.  ## Gameplay
	1. #### Objectives
		<p>The objective of the game is to progress your village as far as possible, either through growth, conquest, research or trade.</p>
	2. #### Progression
		<p>Progression occurs through simply waiting, but can be furthered by smart use of the players luck ability. By simply waiting, villages will be accosted by random occurences and decisions made by entities within the world that will further or hinder the village's prosperity in one way or another. </p>
	3. #### Rules
		<p>The player cannot interact with the village or its inhabitants freely and must use influence in order to do so. Influence is gained through watching the village as it thrives.</p>
	4. #### Game States
		<p>The game has several states:
			- Viewing mode: the game is in this mode most of the time, where the player's camera can freely pan or zoom around the village, watching individuals or the entire village as they progress through their lifespans
			- Inspection mode: the game will enter this mode when the player chooses to an object through a right click or an abstraction of a more general object (button that shows town's history). This mode allows the player to see the stats of an object as well as its historical actions and dialogue sorted in a variety of ways.
			- ssesion mode: when the player wants to posses an entity for a duration, this might allow them to adventure, fight or simply explore in a character's place</p>
2. ## Story
	1. #### Setting
		<p> High fantasy setting. Elves, orcs, goblins, dwarves humans and many more races. Many won't be seen a playthrough but there's a large expansive world that will be randomly generated that a player can start a village in. </p>
	2. #### Plot
		<p> The player is a god that wishes to focus their attention on one village and its inhabitants, in order to help them prosper (usually). Otherwise, the plot is procedurally generated through gameply by having characters from different systems interact with one another. </p>
